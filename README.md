# WP Translation Day 4 - Web Assets

This repository holds all the necessary files for the Theme & Plugins used at wptranslationday.org for our 4th event!

Please use the `develop` branch if you want to make any PRs. The `master` branch will be used for production only.

## About the theme

Our theme is a child-theme of [TwentySeventeen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/). We're also making use of [TGM Plugin Activation](https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation) to require necessary plugns needed for the website to run smoothly.

Those include [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/), [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) (this list might change depending on our on-going development).
